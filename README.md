# duel-score-keeper
A simple score keeper with timer for one on one matches

This score keeper lets the user enter the total number of rounds and the score needed to win each round.
The timer will auto start upon the beginning of each round and the data table will show the score of each players and the time elapsed after each round.

I hope you find my little project useful and entertaining.
